    <h5>About Porsche</h5>

    <p class="history1">Porsche is more than just a car manufacturer; it is a symbol of innovation, performance, and a deep love for motorsport. 
    Since its founding in 1931 by Ferdinand Porsche, the company has been at the forefront of technology and design, creating vehicles that are not only iconic but also characterized by remarkable engineering excellence.
    Porsche's first production car, the Porsche 356, was launched in 1948 and set the standard for future models. 
    Since then, Porsche has evolved into one of the most recognizable and respected automotive brands in the world.</p>

    <p class="history1">At the heart of the Porsche spirit lies the company's focus on performance and driving experience.
         Each vehicle is crafted with precision, and technological advancements are continually implemented to enhance both speed and handling.
         This is particularly evident in models like the Porsche 911, which has been an indispensable part of the Porsche family since its introduction in 1964.
          With its timeless design and superior performance, the 911 has become a legend in its own right, continuing to attract enthusiasts and collectors from around the globe.</p>

    <h5 class="what">The History of Porsche</h5>

    <p class="what">The history of Porsche is a captivating tale of innovation and adventurous spirit. 
        After founding the company, Ferdinand Porsche began developing cars that would set new standards in the automotive industry.
        In 1938, the legendary Volkswagen Beetle, designed by Porsche, was launched, becoming one of the best-selling cars in history. 
        However, World War II forced Porsche to shift its focus, and production was redirected towards military equipment. </p>

    <p class="what">After the war, Porsche emerged with its first sports car, the 356, which quickly garnered a dedicated following. 
        The company grew in tandem with the rising interest in motorsport in the 1950s and 1960s, and Porsche began to dominate the racetracks with its lightweight, high-performance models.
        This laid the foundation for the company’s reputation as an innovator in motorsport, culminating in victories in prestigious competitions like Le Mans.
    </p>

    <p class="what">Over the following decades, Porsche expanded its lineup, introducing several icons such as the Porsche Boxster, Cayenne, and Panamera.
        With a blend of traditional craftsmanship and modern technology, Porsche continues to shape the future of sports cars. 
        Today, the company is not only known for its high-performing vehicles but also for its commitment to sustainable mobility with the launch of electric models like the Taycan, marking a new chapter in Porsche's illustrious history.

    <h5>Records</h5>

    <p class="Records"> Porsche has consistently set records in the automotive world, affirming its legacy as a leader in engineering and performance.
        At the iconic 24 Hours of Le Mans race, Porsche holds the record with 19 overall victories, showcasing its dominance with models like the 917, 935, and the hybrid-powered 919 Hybrid. 
        This dedication to endurance racing has made Porsche synonymous with motorsport excellence. </p>

    <p class="Records"> The Nürburgring, one of the world’s toughest tracks, has also been a proving ground for Porsche. 
        In 2018, the 919 Hybrid Evo shattered the all-time lap record with a time of 5 minutes and 19.55 seconds. 
        Porsche production cars have made their mark here as well, with the Porsche 911 GT2 RS setting a record for street-legal sports cars, demonstrating Porsche’s commitment to track-ready vehicles for everyday drivers. </p>
          
<p class="Records"> In the electric vehicle sector, the Porsche Taycan has set a new standard for performance, achieving world records like the longest continuous drift by an electric vehicle. 
    This all-electric model has become a major part of Porsche’s commitment to sustainable innovation, blending environmental responsibility with Porsche's characteristic speed and handling. </p>
